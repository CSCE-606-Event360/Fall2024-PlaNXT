### Team Working Agreement

#### People and Accountabilities
The accountabilities of each person are rotating each sprint.

**Scrum Master**
- The Scrum Master is responsible for holding the daily stand-up meetings to discuss the progress and roadblocks.
- The scrum master is also responsible for holding the retrospective meeting where he/she guides the team to reflect and improve in future sprints.
- The scrum master is responsible for keeping up the momentum of the team. They should be a primary point of contact for all the developers and by ready to clear any roadblocks that may be slowing down progress.

**Product Owner**
- The product owner is responsible for maximizing product value and is the primary point of contact for the client. The PO will set up client meetings, understand the needs of the client, and incorporate BDD (behavior driven development) to ensure the program features align with the customerâ€™s needs.
- The PO will write cucumber tests to reflect the app behaviors expected by the client.
- The PO must create and prioritize the product backlog and ensure that the user stories align with the needs of the client. They should make sure that developers clearly understand the tasks in the backlog. 

**Developer**
- Expected to develop features for that particular sprint and perform unit testing for the changes for which they are responsible.
- The developer should make sure that all cucumber tests written by the product owner are passing.
- They should attend each standup and scrum meeting and provide regular updates
- Developers are expected to have knowledge-transfers at the end of each sprint to prepare the developers in the next sprint and set them up for success.
- If developers are stuck, they should not hesitate to communicate with the rest of the team and reach out for help.

#### Frequency, Time, and Location
Meet every day, have more in-depth conversations on Monday and Wednesday in class, have smaller <15 minute virtual meetings daily to update the team on progress.

#### Team Approach to work

**Collaboration and communication**
The most important for our team will be to 
communicate and and make sure that everyone is always on the same page about the project. 
Additionally, we will maintain a equal culture where everyone's opinion is valuable and we 
want everyone to pitch ideas and communicate their issues because we need unanimous agreement 
about the direction we are taking. We will also be prompt in our communication and strive to 
respond to each others' questions and concerns in a quick and timely manner. 

**Documentation**
We aim to document everything we do. The agile methodology of user stories and the usage of 
Pivotal Tracker already ensures documentation of small steps and features, but we also want 
to make note of any important information we find during our work. This is especially important
because of the rotating of roles. Since each member will work as a scrum master, product owner,
and developer throughout the course of the project, the transfer of roles needs to be seamless.
Therefore, each member will document their experience in their role and conduct a written and 
verbal knowledge transfer to other members when roles are rotated.  

**Development**
Our approach to development will be highly behavior driven. The most important outcome is to satisfy
the client's needs, and the best way to do so is by habving thorough cucumber scenarios reflecting 
client needs and developing solutions in order to pass those cucumber scenraios.

#### Communication Channels
Slack for communication, Google Meet and Zoom for virtual meetings.

#### Tools
Dev. tools include VSCode

#### Definition of Done
- The code for the feature is written. 
- The code passes all the cucumber tests set by the product owner
- All unit tests with a coverage of greater than 90%. The feature meets the expectations of the client.
